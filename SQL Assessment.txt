Certainly! Here are five SQL questions based on the 'Employees' and 'Departments' tables:

Consider the 'Employees' table with the following columns:

- 'emp_id' (integer, primary key)
- 'emp_name' (string)
- 'department_id' (integer, foreign key referencing 'Departments')
- 'hire_date' (date)


Given the 'Departments' table with the following columns:

- 'dept_id' (integer, primary key)
- 'dept_name' (string)

1.
Write an SQL query to retrieve the names of all employees along with the names of 
their corresponding departments. Include only employees who belong to the 'Sales' 
department. The result should include two columns: 'emp_name' and 'dept_name'.

2.
Given the 'Employees' table, write an SQL query to calculate the average tenure (in years)
 of employees in each department. The tenure is calculated as the difference between the 
 current date and the 'hire_date', rounded to the nearest year. The result should include
  two columns: 'dept_name' and 'AverageTenure'.

3.
Consider the 'Employees' table. Write an SQL query to find the names of employees who 
joined the company after '2020-01-01' and are currently working in the 'Finance'
 department. The result should include only the 'emp_name' column.


4.
Write an SQL query to retrieve the names of departments along with the number 
of employees working in each department. The result should include two columns:
 'dept_name' and 'NumEmployees'.

5.
Consider the 'Employees' table. Write an SQL query to find the names of employees 
who have been with the company for more than 3 years and have a salary greater than
 $50,000. The result should include only the 'emp_name' column.
