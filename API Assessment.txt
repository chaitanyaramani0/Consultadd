Create a simple RESTful API in Python using any framework(Django, FastAPI, etc.) 
that performs CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on a fictional resource, such as "books" or "users". Your API should have endpoints to:

1. Create a new item of the resource.
2. Retrieve a single item of the resource by its unique identifier.
3. Retrieve a list of all items of the resource.
4. Update an existing item of the resource by its unique identifier.
5. Delete an existing item of the resource by its unique identifier.

Ensure that your API responses follow RESTful conventions and return appropriate status codes and response formats. 
You can use in-memory storage (e.g., a list or dictionary) to store the data for simplicity. 
Additionally, provide clear instructions on how to run and test your API.
